# LED-Wall-Arcade
This repository stores the firmware used to control a dual LED panel consisting of 256 LEDs each. Each panel has a 8 by 32 dotmatrix, using two panels side by side results in a 16x32 dotmatrix. 

The used LED panels  consist of WS2812B "neopixel" LEDs. They are controlled by a TinyK22 microcontroller board, developed by Lucerne University of Applied Sciences.
